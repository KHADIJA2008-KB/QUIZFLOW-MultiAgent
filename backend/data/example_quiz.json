      "options": ["O(1)", "O(n)", "O(log n)", "O(n²)"],
      "correct_answer": "O(1)",
      "explanation": "Array access by index is constant time O(1) because we can directly calculate the memory address."

      "options": ["Queue", "Stack", "Array", "Linked List"],
      "correct_answer": "Stack",
      "explanation": "A stack follows LIFO where the last element added is the first one to be removed."

      "question": "Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n²) in the worst case.",
      "correct_answer": "True",
      "explanation": "Bubble sort compares adjacent elements and has O(n²) time complexity in worst and average cases."

      "question": "What is the time complexity of binary search?",
      "correct_answer": "O(log n)",
      "explanation": "Binary search eliminates half of the search space in each iteration, resulting in O(log n) complexity."

      "question": "Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from multiple parent classes in all programming languages.",
      "correct_answer": "False",
      "explanation": "Multiple inheritance is not supported by all languages. For example, Java supports single inheritance only."
